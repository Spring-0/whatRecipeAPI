# whatRecipeAPI

Find all kinds of recipes from healthy to junk food. Have any food restrictions such as peanuts, beef, and pork? This will show you the recipe for you! (at least it will in the future ðŸ¤£)

## Description

whatRecipeAPI is my first attempt at creating an API, I am sure that some of the code will be flawed so if you spot something that can be done in a more efficient way please let me know either in the issues tab or on discord ( Spring#9999 ), or maybe twitter I don't check that as often.
